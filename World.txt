A regular expression (regex) defines a search pattern for strings. The search pattern world can be anything from a simple character, a fixed string or a complex expression containing special characters describing the pattern.
A regex can be used to search, edit and manipulate text, this process is called: The regular expression is applied to world the text/string.
The regex is applied on the text from left to right World. Once a source character has been used in a match, it cannot be reused. For example, the regex aba will match ababababa only two times (aba_aba__).
